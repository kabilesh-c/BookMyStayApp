# 🏨 BookMyStayApp

## 📌 Overview

BookMyStayApp is a Java-based Hotel Booking Application developed as part of **placement exam training**.

This project focuses on strengthening:

- Core Java Concepts
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Software Design Principles
- Structured Application Development

# 📥 Use Case 5 (UC5) – Booking Request Queue

## 🎯 Goal
Handle multiple booking requests fairly using a queue system that preserves request order.

---

## 🔄 Flow

- Guest submits booking request
- Request is added to queue
- Requests stored in arrival order
- Queue waits for processing
- No inventory updates

---

## 🧠 Key Concepts Used

### 🔹 Queue (FIFO)
First request → First processed

### 🔹 Fairness
Ensures no request skips another

### 🔹 Decoupling
Request intake separated from allocation logic

### 🔹 Ordering Guarantee
Queue maintains insertion order automatically

---

## ✅ Key Requirements Implemented

- Accept booking requests
- Store using Queue<Reservation>
- Maintain FIFO order
- No inventory mutation

---

---

## 🚀 Scalability

Adding a new room type requires:

inventory.registerRoom("Deluxe Room", 4);

## 🧠 Key Concepts Used

### 🔹 Abstract Class
- `Room` class defines common structure for all room types.
- Cannot be instantiated directly.

### 🔹 Inheritance
- `SingleRoom`
- `DoubleRoom`
- `SuiteRoom`
  extend the abstract `Room` class.

### 🔹 Polymorphism
Room objects are referenced using the `Room` type.

### 🔹 Encapsulation
Room attributes are private and accessed via getters.

### 🔹 Static Availability Representation
Availability stored using simple variables.

### 🔹 Separation of Domain and State
- Room → what a room is
- Availability → current system state

## 🔀 Development Workflow

This project follows an industry-style branching strategy:

- `main` → Stable production base
- `dev` → Integration branch
- `feature/UC1-WelcomePage` → Feature implementation
- Pull Request → Merge feature into `dev`

This workflow reflects how real software teams manage features and releases.
